## Cisco DevNet Learning Labs: Sample Code for Application Hosting and the Network

In this module you will explore different options available for running code and hosting applications at the edge of the network, directly on switches, routers and other devices.   

Labs are written to be displayed within the [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs system](https://learninglabs.cisco.com).

Contributions are welcome, and we are glad to review changes through pull requests. See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

The goal of these learning labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.

## About these Learning Labs

Each directory for sample code has its own README for information about each sample.

* [Cloud to Fogâ€¦ Why Host Apps in the Network](intro/README.md)
* [Linux at the Edge: Introduction to Guest Shell](guestshell/README.md)
* [Python at the Edge: Super Charged Network Event Management](python_onbox/README.md)
